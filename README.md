# machine-learning-on-ants
Hello, we are a team of students doing a project to study the behavior of ants using machine vision.
Our tasks: Automation of formicaria. Tracking ants and creating a dataset with their behavior.
Creation of a full-fledged formicaria with temperature and humidity sensors and a camera that determines the non-standard behavior of ants.
